## Various scenes created in Unity  
---  

Most of these projects are created during my 6th semester as part of the "Computer Games" subject. Some, though, are created following the Unity Learn platform and yt channels in order to practice my unity and scripting skills.  

* #### Grenade  
These scene is all about simulating a grenade throw and explosion mechanics.  

* #### Terrain  
It is a lovely 250x250 woody terrain with some additional post-processing and other effects applied. Perfect for Sunday chilling!      
* #### AI-arena  
It is an attempt to create a game with intelligent enemies, based on state machine (FSM). Player has to lure all enemies into traps.
